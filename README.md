# Java - Programs
All programs created for java related work. Any larger projects may be inside their own repo.
> ## Overview:
>---
> This repository is for both school and personal projects. Navigating the repository works similar to the java programs repo found [here](https://github.com/Droiidd/javaPrograms).

> ## Navigation:
> Within the repository there are various subfolders for each semester / school year: *"Spring-2022"*. 
>This is primarily used as an archive for school work. Typical projects and homework, nothing special to look at.
>
>If there is any non-school related work, it will be found within that file. Most of the files are unorganized and could use some work!
